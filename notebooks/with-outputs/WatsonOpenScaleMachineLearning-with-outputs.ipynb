This notebook can be set up with your WML credentials, and scheduled to provide a consistent flow of scoring requests to your model, which will appear in your OpenScale monitors.\n",

Please note that the payload and measurement logs for the previous deployment will continue to be stored in your datamart, and can be deleted if necessary."
